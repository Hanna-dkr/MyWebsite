                                        expertise—knowledge shaped by experience, not credentials. Listening to traders
                                        wasn’t just a method for collecting insights; it was a way to make space for
                                        them to define their own realities. In a system that often sidelines or speaks
                                        over them, being heard carried real weight. As someone involved in shaping
                                        outcomes, I came to understand that listening isn’t neutral—it redistributes
                                        influence. When the people most affected help shape the story, the outcomes are
                                        more grounded—and they work better.</p>

                                    <p class="cg-p">After working closely with traders over two years, I’ve kept coming
                                        back to the trust they placed in us. They shared insight, lived experience and
                                        time—often during their working hours. They were willing participants, knowing
                                        that the outcome of the project could meaningfully affect their livelihoods.
                                        Although we were transparent about the uncertainties around implementation, I
                                        sometimes wonder if the process asked too much of them, especially given the
                                        long delays that followed. This experience reminded me that incentivisation in
                                        design isn’t just about tokens or stipends. It’s about understanding what’s at
                                        stake for the people involved, and taking responsibility for the weight of their
                                        trust—especially when outcomes are slow, partial, or unclear.</p>

                                    <p class="cg-p">Facilitating participatory workshops taught me how to
                                        create
                                        space
                                        for different voices—especially those often excluded from formal
                                        processes.
                                        It
                                        required
                                        active listening, flexibility, and the ability to guide discussion
                                        without
                                        dominating
                                        it. Working closely with the community facilitator and translator was
                                        essential—not
                                        just
                                        for communication, but for building trust and cultural understanding.
                                        Through
                                        this,
                                        I
                                        learned how to surface tensions respectfully, balance competing needs,
                                        and
                                        keep
                                        conversations focused and meaningful, even when the topics were complex
                                        or
                                        emotionally
                                        charged.</p>

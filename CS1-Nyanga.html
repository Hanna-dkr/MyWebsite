                                Despite our efforts to manage expectations, many traders became deeply engaged in the
                                co-design process. They showed up, contributed, and hoped. And then—for nearly a
                                decade—nothing changed.

                                That experience taught me something that’s still with me today:

                                When people share their time, insight, and trust, they’re doing more than participating
                                in a process—they’re investing in a possible future.
                                And that means designers carry a responsibility that extends beyond the proposal stage.

                                In 2021, the City of Cape Town returned to SUN Development to revisit the project and
                                build on the work we produced. I was no longer with the team—but that decision showed
                                the long-term value of the research and strategic foundations we had laid.

                                Still, I’ve never forgotten what it felt like to leave a project where real people were
                                left waiting.

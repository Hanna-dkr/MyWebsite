                                    busy, but unsafe and under-resourced public transport hub in Nyanga for
                                    regeneration. As part of a non-profit consortium contracted to deliver an
                                    insight-driven urban design proposal, I worked as part of a multidisciplinary team
                                    to understand the needs of informal traders—a central but underserved group in the
                                    area. My work surfaced actionable insights that shaped a regeneration plan grounded
                                    in inclusion, safety, and economic resilience. </p>

                                aligning diverse stakeholders around actionable insights. This case study shows how I

                                approach that directly mirrors UX methods. My goal in sharing this work is to highlight

                                and economically challenged neighborhoods, the site faced persistent problems with
                                crime, overcrowding, and unregulated informal trade. Hundreds of informal traders
                                operated daily, playing a vital role in the local economy—but also contributing to
                                sidewalk congestion and regulatory friction with the City. From the municipality’s
                                perspective, this created a need for a safer, more organized public space that balanced
                                enforcement with economic support. Our team, SUN Development, was commissioned to design
                                a comprehensive regeneration plan, including a trading strategy that supported the
                                informal economy rather than displacing it.</p>

                        A comprehensive trading plan

                        A land release and maintenance strategy

                                            their
                                            livelihoods. Although we were transparent about the uncertainties around
                                            implementation,
                                            I sometimes wonder if the process asked too much of them, especially given
                                            the
                                            long
                                            delays that followed. When people invest in a vision that isn’t realised, it
                                            can
                                            leave
                                            behind more than disappointment. It’s a reminder that trust in design
                                            processes
                                            carries
                                            responsibility beyond participation—it asks us to remain mindful of the
                                            long-term
                                            impact
                                            of engagement itself.</p>

                                            create
                                            space
                                            for different voices—especially those often excluded from formal processes.
                                            It
                                            required
                                            active listening, flexibility, and the ability to guide discussion without

                                            it. Working closely with the community facilitator and translator was
                                            essential—not
                                            just
                                            for communication, but for building trust and cultural understanding.

                                            conversations focused and meaningful, even when the topics were complex or
